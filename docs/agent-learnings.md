# Agent Learnings

This file is **automatically maintained** by the framework. The Memory Writer agent appends learnings after each merged PR. The Memory Gardener runs weekly to prune stale, duplicate, or low-value entries.

**Do not add project conventions here** — those belong in `CLAUDE.md`. This file is for things discovered through experience: CI gotchas, rejected approaches, environmental quirks, and decisions made during actual PRs.

**Format for entries:**

```
### [YYYY-MM-DD] PR #N: Short description
**Category:** environment | architecture | testing | gotcha | pattern | decision
**Learning:** Specific, actionable learning in 1-2 sentences.
**Files:** relevant/paths (if applicable)
```
